# FAQ

## My progress/grades are not updating.

Make sure you've saved and submitted all of the graded problems. Please allow up to 1 hour for grades to update.

## I finished a section but it's not showing as completed/green checkmark.

Ensure that you have completed the content on the page:

- For text content, you'll need to have stayed on the page long enough to read the text.
- For video content, ensure that you have watched the video to completion.

## I'm stuck/unable to submit answers for problem questions.

Try again using Incognito/Private Browsing.
Sometimes browser extensions can cause issues with being able to submit a problem; using private browsing can help
to verify that the issue is not caused by an extension.
