# Activities

An activity is a lightweight, self-contained learning asset designed for quick consumption and easy distribution through the Skills Network Catalog and Portals. Unlike full Courses or Guided Projects, Activities focus on delivering a single, high-value piece of content—such as a video, assignment, lab, or podcast—without requiring learners to enroll in a larger program.

## Activity Components

Activities can include a wide variety of asset types, such as:

- Videos and podcasts
- Interactive labs
- Assignments or exercises
- Readings or short articles
- Quizzes or assessments

## Activity Features

- **Lightweight**: Designed for fast creation and quick learner engagement  
- **Standalone**: Distributed as individual assets, not bundled into larger courses  
- **Flexible**: Can be curated like other catalog items and surfaced in Portals  
- **Accessible**: Easy entry point for learners without enrollment barriers  
- **Certifications**: May include badges or certificates, depending on the asset type  

## Learning Experience

Activities provide learners with an immediate and frictionless way to engage with educational content. Whether it’s watching a video, completing a short lab, or listening to a podcast, Activities offer a focused, on-demand experience that complements larger learning journeys.
