# Personalized Learning Plan

Personalized learning plans are tailored educational experiences designed to meet the unique needs and goals of each learner. They allow individuals to progress through courses, guided projects, and learning paths at their own pace. Learners can track their progress, view details about their courses, and receive timely reminders from a success coach. This personalized approach helps learners stay motivated and achieve their educational objectives efficiently.

Learners can create a personalized learning plan by selecting the courses and guided projects that they want to complete in a specific order in a certain time frame.
