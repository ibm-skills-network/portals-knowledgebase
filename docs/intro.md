# Introduction

Welcome to the **Skills Network Portals Knowledgebase**. We are in the process of building this knowledgebase to help you build **amazing content** with Portals.

## What are Portals?

Portals are an online learning platform, with access to content from the Skills Network Catalog and other catalogs. With Portals, you can enroll in courses, complete courses and guided projects and track your progress.

A Skills Network Portal allows you to:

- Access Learning Materials: Find and enroll in courses, guided projects, and access study resources.
- Track Progress: Monitor your learning journey and see your progress in different courses.
- Engage with the Community: Participate in discussions, ask questions, and connect with other learners.
- Get Support: Create support tickets, access help resources, and find answers to your questions.
- Learn using hands-on labs: Our interactive lab environments (Skills Network Labs) allow you to practice what you learned without additional set up on your device.
- Leverage AI to learn: The platform has several AI assistants that can help you learn, answer questions, and recommend content.
